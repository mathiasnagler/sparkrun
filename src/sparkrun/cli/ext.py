"""Plugin-contributed CLI commands.

External plugins add Click commands/groups to the sparkrun CLI by calling
:func:`register_cli_command` at import time (or in their ``register(v)`` hook),
e.g.::

    from sparkrun.cli.ext import register_cli_command
    register_cli_command(my_command)                          # top-level: `sparkrun my-command`
    register_cli_command(import_foo, parent=("cluster", "import"))  # `sparkrun cluster import foo`

The registry itself lives in :mod:`sparkrun.core.cli_registry`, deliberately
free of Click: a plugin that also loads on the console-free ``sparkrun.api``
path should import *that* and register a **loader** rather than a built
command, so registering costs no Click import.  This module re-exports the
registry API and owns the attach half, which needs Click.

**Timing.** The CLI command tree is built at import of :mod:`sparkrun.cli`, but
external plugins load later, during :func:`sparkrun.core.bootstrap.init_sparkrun`.
:class:`PluggableGroup` bridges the gap: the top-level ``main`` group is a
``PluggableGroup``, so the first time Click resolves *any* subcommand it runs
:func:`ensure_cli_extensions` — which loads plugins (they call
``register_cli_command``) and attaches every registered command to its target
group (walking into nested groups like ``cluster import``) before Click
dispatches.  A plugin command therefore shows up in ``--help`` and dispatches
like a built-in.

Command selection is deliberately *not* tied to the transport/executor
abstractions — plugins map to commands however makes sense for them.  Per-command
gating (feature flags, ``hidden=``) is the command's own concern.
