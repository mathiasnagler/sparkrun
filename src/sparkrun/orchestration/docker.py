    Docker's implementation of the substrate-agnostic teardown protocol (see
    :mod:`sparkrun.orchestration.teardown`), reached via
    :meth:`~sparkrun.orchestration.executors.docker.DockerExecutor.teardown_script`.

    :func:`docker_stop_cmd` ends in ``|| true`` so a candidate name that
    was never running doesn't fail the chain -- which also means a *real*
    docker failure (daemon down, permission denied, no docker binary)
    exits 0 and reads as a successful teardown.  Callers that need a
    truthful answer use this instead: a census, the removals, then a
    verification pass.  It

    - fails if docker could not be queried before or after,
    - fails, listing them, if any target container survived, and
    - prints ``sparkrun_removed=<n>`` counting the containers that were
      **present when we started**, not the removals attempted.

    That last distinction is the reason for the leading census.  ``docker rm
    -f`` exits **0 for a container that does not exist** (verified on Docker
    28 and on Thunder's custom daemon), so counting successful removals
    counted every candidate name -- and ``enumerate_containers`` hands this
    the solo / head / worker / node_N shapes for every host, of which at most
    one is real.  ``sparkrun stop`` reported "removed 4 containers" for a
    single-container job, and reported removals on hosts holding nothing.

    Args:
        container_names: Candidate container names to remove.  Names that
