"""``sparkrun.api.search_recipes`` — the recipe catalog.

The console-free counterpart to ``sparkrun list`` / ``sparkrun recipe
search``: enumerate and filter the recipes reachable from the configured
registries plus the working directory, without resolving any of them.

Scoping a query to one registry is part of the query itself —
``@community`` and ``@community/qwen`` — so a GUI search box gets the same
shorthand the CLI offers, and the filter is validated identically (see
:func:`sparkrun.core.registry.resolve_registry_filter`).

    Args:
        query: Free-text query matched (case-insensitively, substring) against
            recipe name, file stem, model, and description.  ``None`` or empty
            matches everything.  A leading ``@registry`` scopes the search:
            ``@community`` and ``@community/`` mean "that registry", and
            anything after the ``/`` is the remaining query, so
            ``@community/qwen`` is the community registry filtered by ``qwen``.
        registry: Explicit registry filter.  Equivalent to the ``@registry``
            scope, and validated the same way; supplying both with different
            names raises rather than silently picking one.
        runtime: Keep only recipes with this runtime (case-insensitive).
        include_hidden: Include registries flagged ``visible: false``.  A
            registry filter implies this — naming a registry is a stronger
            signal than its default visibility — so it only matters for an
            unscoped search.
        include_local: Include recipes discovered in the current working
            directory.  They carry no registry and are listed first, so a
            local override is easy to spot.  Ignored when a registry filter
            is in effect, since a local recipe belongs to no registry.
        unique_names: Collapse to one entry per unqualified name (first match
            wins, working-directory recipes first) — the view in which typing
            a bare recipe name is unambiguous, as ``sparkrun list`` shows it.
            The default keeps every copy, so a catalog browser can show
            ``@atlas/foo`` and ``@eugr/foo`` — or two same-stem variants
            within one registry — side by side.
        ensure_initialized: Clone not-yet-cached registries on first use.
            Best-effort: a failure is logged and the search proceeds against
            whatever is already cached.  Pass ``False`` to guarantee no
            network access.
        sctx: Optional shared :class:`SparkrunContext`.

    Returns:
        :class:`RecipeSummary` entries.  Working-directory recipes first,
        then registry recipes in configured-registry order.

    Raises:
        InvalidRegistryFilter: The registry filter (explicit or from the
            query scope) is unknown, disabled, or self-contradictory.
