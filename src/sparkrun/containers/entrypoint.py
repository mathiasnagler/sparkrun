"""Preflight: does an image's ENTRYPOINT pass sparkrun's command through?

sparkrun composes every workload as ``docker run <opts> <image> bash -c
<b64 command>`` — the command is always appended as **CMD arguments**.  Docker
hands those arguments to the image's ENTRYPOINT, so what happens next depends
entirely on which of two opposite idioms the image uses:

- **Passthrough** — the ENTRYPOINT is a wrapper that does setup and ends in
  ``exec "$@"``.  ``/opt/nvidia/nvidia_entrypoint.sh``, which nearly every
  NGC-derived image inherits, is this.  sparkrun's command runs normally and
  clearing the ENTRYPOINT would *skip* the wrapper's setup.
- **Consuming** — the ENTRYPOINT names a binary plus subcommand, e.g.
  ``ENTRYPOINT ["vllm","serve"]``.  sparkrun's ``bash -c <cmd>`` is parsed as
  *that program's flags*, so the workload never starts.

``docker image inspect`` cannot tell them apart — both are simply a non-empty
ENTRYPOINT — so this module settles it empirically by running the real argv
shape and checking for a sentinel.  The failure it prevents is otherwise close
to undiagnosable: the consumed launcher surfaces as an error about whatever
flag the consuming program happened to mis-parse, and the container's own serve
log is destroyed with the container on exit.

Called through :meth:`~sparkrun.orchestration.executors._base.Executor.verify_command_passthrough`
so the question stays substrate-dispatched, and best-effort throughout — only a
*confirmed* consuming entrypoint is reported.  Kill switch:
``SPARKRUN_NO_IMAGE_PROBE=1``.
