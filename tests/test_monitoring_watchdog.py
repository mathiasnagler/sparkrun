"""Tests for ClusterMonitor's reconnect watchdog.

Covers the two deadlines the watchdog enforces:

- **staleness** — a host that delivered samples and then went quiet
  (``last_updated`` ages past ``interval * 5``).
- **first sample** — a host that has *never* delivered a sample since its
  connect attempt (``last_updated is None``, so nothing can go stale).  Without
  this second deadline a boot race, a half-open TCP connection, or an SSH that
  hangs before its first line wedges that host for the life of the process —
  ``cluster monitor --json`` then streams ``sample: null`` for it forever
  (spark-arena/sparkrun#236).

The watchdog is driven synchronously here: the module's ``time`` is swapped for
a fake whose ``sleep`` advances a controllable clock and stops the loop after a
fixed number of passes, so no test sleeps for real.
