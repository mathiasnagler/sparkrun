    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refuses to write *through* a symlink, so another local user
    can't pre-create one at a predictable path and capture what we write. It is
    POSIX-only: on Windows ``os.O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist, and naming it
    directly raises ``AttributeError`` — which callers that wrap the write in a
    broad ``except`` will swallow, leaving the file silently unwritten. (That is
    exactly how a Windows control machine ended up with no job metadata for jobs
    it had launched, so ``logs`` and ``stop`` could not find their hosts.)

    ``O_BINARY`` matters on Windows for the same reason it does elsewhere in
    sparkrun: text mode would rewrite ``\\n`` on write.

        A file descriptor opened ``O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC`` with mode 0600.
