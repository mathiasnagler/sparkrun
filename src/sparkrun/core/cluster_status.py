"""Cluster status dataclasses — the shape of "what's running where?"

This module is **data only**.  Production of :class:`ClusterStatus`
lives behind the :class:`~sparkrun.orchestration.executors._base.Executor`
ABC's ``query_status`` method — there is no separate extension point
for status providers.  Each Executor knows how to inspect its own
backend (Docker via ``docker ps``, K8s via ``kubectl get pods``, …).

Consumers (the ``occupancy-sparse`` and ``occupancy-dense`` schedulers,
the ``sparkrun status`` CLI, the ``cluster monitor`` TUI) all flow
through ``sparkrun.api.status`` → ``executor.query_status``.
