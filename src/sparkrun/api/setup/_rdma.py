"""RDMA fabric verification — console-free implementation of ``setup rdma-test``.

Orchestrates the mechanism in :mod:`sparkrun.orchestration.rdma` into a report.
Host resolution is the caller's job (the setup-command convention): these take
an already-resolved ``host_list`` + ``ssh_kwargs``, not a cluster selector.

Three things here are policy rather than mechanism, and each is deliberate:

- **Verdicts are advisory; numbers are the product.** A link that measures
  below expectation is a ``WARN``, never a ``FAIL``. Only a test that could
  not run at all fails, because "your fabric is slower than we hoped" and
  "your fabric does not work" call for completely different responses, and
  a command that conflates them teaches people to ignore it.
- **The expectation is derived, not hardcoded.** It comes from the link's own
  sysfs-reported rate (:func:`~sparkrun.orchestration.rdma.rate_to_gbps`), so
  the check is meaningful on hardware that is not a DGX Spark. Hardcoding
  "100 Gb/s" would misreport every other NVIDIA platform.
- **The container is required only by the NCCL suite.** perftest ships
  preinstalled on DGX OS and needs no CUDA, so the common "did my cable
  work?" check costs no image pull. The image is a fallback there and a
  requirement only for the collective.

    """Verify RDMA bandwidth, latency and (optionally) a NCCL collective.

    Args:
        sctx: Sparkrun context, for config-resolved defaults.
        host_list: Already-resolved hosts.
        ssh_kwargs: Already-built SSH parameters.
        suite: ``perftest`` (default), ``nccl`` or ``all``. perftest is the
            default because it answers the common question — is the fabric
            carrying traffic at line rate — host-native when available, with
            no image pull. Every selected path is tested in both directions.
            The collective needs the container on every host.
        cluster: Selected cluster definition, for topology and fabric interface
            constraints. Without it, coverage is limited to observed subnets.
        parallel_pairs: Maximum simultaneous host-disjoint pairs (default 4),
            bounded by the available hosts. Set to 1 for serial measurements.
        full: Test all candidate paths instead of the default spanning chain
            on each subnet. Both modes validate the complete inventory and keep
            both directions and aggregates. NCCL always uses all selected hosts.
        image: Test image override.
        duration: Seconds per bandwidth test.
        queue_pairs: perftest ``-q``.
        msg_size: nccl-tests message size.
        nccl_binary: nccl-tests binary to run.
        gid_index: perftest ``-x`` override.
        link_type: perftest ``--force-link``; ``None`` to omit.
        force_container: Use the image even when perftest is on the host.
        keep_containers: Leave containers running for debugging.
        dry_run: Resolve and plan without running anything.

    Returns:
        The report. Coverage failures prevent transfers; failed or incomplete
        transfers fail the report. Underperformance produces warnings.

    Raises:
        RdmaTestError: Invalid arguments, or required containers could not be
            prepared. Discovery and coverage failures are returned in the report.
