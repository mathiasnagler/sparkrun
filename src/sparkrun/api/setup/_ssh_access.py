"""Console-free SSH access bootstrap for cluster setup.

Everything in this module works from a bare **Windows** control machine: no
local ``bash``, no third-party SSH library.  The only external binaries used
are ``ssh`` and ``ssh-keygen`` from OpenSSH, which ship with Windows 10+ and
with every Linux/macOS distribution sparkrun targets.

The bootstrap is a three-step loop, each step exposed separately so a CLI
wizard, the desktop app's sidecar, or a future setup-steps registry can drive
it with their own presentation:

1. :func:`probe_ssh_access` — can we already reach every host non-interactively?
2. :func:`ensure_local_key` — find (or generate) the key we would install.
3. :func:`install_public_key_interactive` — install it using password auth.

Step 3 is the one place the "console-free" rule bends: OpenSSH reads the
password from the terminal itself, so the child process inherits the console.
The api layer still writes nothing of its own, and the *result* of the install
is never inferred from the output — callers re-run :func:`probe_ssh_access` to
confirm, which is the only trustworthy signal anyway.
