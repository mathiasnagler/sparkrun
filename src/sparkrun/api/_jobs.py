"""``sparkrun.api.list_jobs`` — enumerate persisted job metadata.

Walks ``~/.cache/sparkrun/jobs/*.yaml`` (or a caller-supplied
``cache_dir``) and surfaces each as a :class:`~sparkrun.api.JobInfo`.
Stale entries whose YAML fails to parse are logged at debug and
skipped — the function never raises on a single bad file.

    Args:
        cache_dir: Override for the sparkrun cache root.  Takes
            precedence when set.  Otherwise falls back to
            ``sctx.config.cache_dir`` (when *sctx* is provided), then
            to :data:`sparkrun.core.config.resolve_sparkrun_cache_dir()`.
        limit: Return at most this many of the most recent jobs, and —
            crucially — only parse that many files.  See below.
        sctx: Optional shared :class:`SparkrunContext`.

    Returns:
        :class:`JobInfo` entries sorted by ``started_at`` descending
        (most recent first); entries without a timestamp come last,
        ordered by ``cluster_id``.

    **On ``limit`` and why it exists.** Each metadata file embeds the full
    serialized recipe state (command template, env, metadata, hooks), so the
    cost here is dominated by YAML parsing, not by the directory walk: an
    unpruned cache of ~740 jobs is ~1.7 MB and takes ~1.5 s to load. That is
    fine for a report and far too slow for shell completion, which runs on
    every TAB.

    So ``limit`` pre-ranks by file **mtime** — a stat per file, no parsing —
    and parses only the top N, then re-sorts that subset by the resolved
    ``started_at``. mtime is a proxy: a job whose file was rewritten later
    than it was launched could in principle rank above a newer job and
    displace it from the window. That is the deliberate trade, and it is the
    same proxy :func:`_resolve_started_at` already falls back to, so a cache
    written before ``started_at`` existed ranks identically either way.
    Callers that need exactness omit ``limit``.
