"""``sparkrun.api.find_running_intent`` — "is this workload already up?"

The question ``--ensure`` asks.  It is deliberately keyed on the **intent**
(recipe + parallelism + port) rather than on a ``cluster_id``, because a
cluster_id also encodes *placement* — and placement is not stable:

* Under a status-aware scheduler (``occupancy-*``) each launch gets a random
  placement token, so no host-derived cluster_id can ever match a running job.
* Even under the deterministic (greedy) scheduler the token is a hash of a
  host set, so asking with a different host list than the launch used misses.

``--ensure`` previously derived a cluster_id from ``(recipe, hosts)`` and so
inherited both failure modes: on an occupancy cluster it *always* reported
"not running" and launched a duplicate.  Matching the intent instead answers
the question the flag is actually asking — "is this workload already serving,
wherever it happens to be?" — and gives the same answer regardless of which
scheduler placed it.
