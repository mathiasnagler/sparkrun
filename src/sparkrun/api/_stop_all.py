"""``sparkrun.api.stop_all`` — discover and stop every sparkrun workload.

The discovery-driven counterpart to :func:`sparkrun.api.stop`: instead of
naming a workload, sweep a set of hosts for whatever sparkrun launched
and tear all of it down.

This is console-free like the rest of ``sparkrun.api`` — it returns a
:class:`~sparkrun.api._models.StopAllResult` describing what was found,
what was removed, and what failed; rendering and exit codes are the
caller's business.  (It previously lived inside the CLI's ``--all``
branch, which meant the GUI sidecar and any other library caller had no
way to do it and no way to inherit its fixes.)

Two failure modes are distinguished, and neither is ever silently
reported as success:

- **discovery errors** — a host that could not be queried.  It is *not*
  "nothing to stop"; it may be running containers we never saw.
- **teardown failures** — a host whose containers did not confirm gone.
  Job metadata for anything with a container there is deliberately
  retained, because the workload is still live and the metadata is how
  it is found again.
