"""Shared base for the occupancy-sparse / occupancy-dense schedulers.

This module is **private** to the schedulers package — it carries the
shared layout/fallback/packing logic for the public
:class:`~sparkrun.schedulers.sparse_pack.SparsePackScheduler` and
:class:`~sparkrun.schedulers.dense_pack.DensePackScheduler` plugins.

Both public schedulers inherit from :class:`_OccupancyAwareBase` and
override two strategy hooks:

- :meth:`_OccupancyAwareBase._sort_hosts` — orders the candidate host list
  by effective load before packing begins.  Sparse variants sort ascending
  (least-loaded first); dense variants sort descending (most-loaded
  first).
- :meth:`_OccupancyAwareBase._select_gpu_index` — picks a local GPU on the
  current host.  Sparse variants pick the GPU with the *most* remaining
  util budget that still fits; dense variants pick the one with the
  *least* remaining util budget that still fits (classical best-fit).

The base class never registers as a scheduler (its
:attr:`scheduler_name` is ``""``) and ``bootstrap.init_sparkrun`` skips
plugins with empty :attr:`scheduler_name` so only the concrete subclasses
appear in :func:`list_schedulers`.

Head-node overhead heuristic
============================

The head node of any existing workload (rank 0's host) typically does
extra coordination work compared to its rank-only peers.  We model that
with :attr:`HEAD_NODE_OVERHEAD` — a small constant (5%) added to a
host's effective *load score* when the heuristic identifies it as the
head of a previously-launched workload.

The overhead is used **only** for sparse/dense decision-making
(ordering and tie-breaking).  It is **never** subtracted from a host's
real capacity — a host that physically still has room is still
considered eligible regardless of head status.

The heuristic does not have rank-position information in
:class:`~sparkrun.core.cluster_status.ClusterStatus`, so it groups every
:class:`~sparkrun.core.cluster_status.RunningWorkload` by
``cluster_id`` and calls the host with the most ranks for a given
cluster_id the "head" (lexicographic host name breaks ties).  This is a
best-effort signal; it degrades gracefully when no status is provided.
