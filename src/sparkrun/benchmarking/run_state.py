    Benchmark identity follows the recipe *intent* (port, parallelism, runtime,

    parsed via :func:`parse_cluster_id` and only its intent half is hashed, so a
    benchmark resumes successfully across relaunches that produce a fresh
    placement token but represent the same logical workload.

    ``hosts`` is the *measured node set*, and it is hashed separately from — and
    for the opposite reason to — the discarded placement token.  The two are
    easy to conflate but are not the same thing: ``api.run`` mints a **random**
    placement token per launch, so hashing that would break resume across
    relaunches; a host set is stable, and a run against different nodes is a
    different measurement.  Dropping both is what let two concurrent per-node
    runs share one state directory and silently serve one node's cached results
    as the other's (issue #267) — invisible in the output, and it read as "these
    nodes perform identically", which is a conclusion someone acts on.  Pass the
    *resolved* host list (what actually ran), not the candidate set.

    ``recipe_fingerprint`` extends the identity to the recipe's *content*
    (declared serve configuration + user overrides): two recipes that share an
    intent — same model, port, parallelism — but differ in a serve argument
    (e.g. ``--speculative-config``) are different workloads and must never
    resume into each other's results.  Obtain it from
    :func:`sparkrun.benchmarking.metadata.benchmark_recipe_fingerprint`,
    which excludes credential fields from the shared fingerprint of declared
    configuration. Resolved artifacts and placement remain excluded, keeping
    it stable across relaunches of the same logical workload.
