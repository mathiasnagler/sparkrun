"""Reading :class:`~sparkrun.core.log_source.LogSource` streams into lines.

The transport half of the log path.  A runtime says *what* to read
(:meth:`~sparkrun.runtimes.base.RuntimePlugin.log_sources`), an executor
says *how* to read it on its substrate
(:meth:`~sparkrun.orchestration.executors._base.Executor.read_logs_cmd`),
and this module actually runs those commands — locally or over SSH — and
turns their output into :class:`~sparkrun.core.log_source.LogLine` records.

Ordering contract (deliberate, and not the same in both modes):

* ``follow=True`` — one reader thread per source feeding a shared queue, so
  lines are yielded **as they arrive**.  That is true time order for live
  streaming, and each line is stamped with its arrival time.
* ``follow=False`` — sources are read **rank-grouped**: each source in full,
  head first, then workers by rank.  Cross-host time-interleaving is not
  possible here: the serve log written by ``scripts/exec_serve_detached.sh``
  carries no per-line capture timestamps, and a dump delivers every line at
  once, so arrival time carries no information either.  Inferring order from
  the runtime's own log prefixes would silently mis-order every unstamped
  line (tracebacks, progress bars, warnings), which is worse than honest
  grouping.  Getting true dump ordering requires stamping at capture time in
  the launch redirect — a deliberate, separate change.

``sparkrun.api.logs`` composes this into the public iterator; the CLI
renders it.  Nothing here imports ``api`` (layering).

    Mirrors the dispatch every other orchestration primitive uses
    (:func:`~sparkrun.orchestration.ssh.should_run_locally`), so reading a
    workload on the control machine itself doesn't pointlessly round-trip
    through sshd — and doesn't break when SSH-to-self isn't configured.

    The two branches quote differently, and must. Locally the argv reaches
    ``execve`` untouched, so *command* is already a single argument. Over SSH
    it does not: ``ssh`` joins its trailing argv into one string and the
    remote login shell re-splits it on whitespace. An unquoted
    ``["bash", "-c", command]`` therefore arrives as
    ``bash -c docker exec … tail …``, where ``bash -c`` takes only ``docker``
    as the command and the rest become ``$0, $1, …`` — so the remote runs a
    bare ``docker`` and prints its help instead of the logs. Quoting collapses
    *command* back into the single word ``bash -c`` expects.
